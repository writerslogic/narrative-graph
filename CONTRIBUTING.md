# Contributing to HMS

First off, thank you for considering contributing to HMS! It's people like you that make the open-source community such a great place to learn, inspire, and create.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs
- Use the GitHub Issue Tracker.
- Describe the bug and provide steps to reproduce.
- Include environment details (Node version, OS, Rust version).

### Suggesting Enhancements
- Open an issue to discuss your idea before implementing it.

### Pull Requests
1. Fork the repo.
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`).
3. Commit your changes.
4. Push to the branch.
5. Open a Pull Request.

## Development Setup

1. Install Rust via `rustup` (MSRV: 1.89).
2. Install Node.js dependencies: `npm install`.
3. Build the native module: `npm run build`.
4. Run tests: `cargo test --workspace --lib`.

## Style Guidelines
- **Rust**: Follow `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings` (zero warnings required).
- **JavaScript**: Use 2-space indentation and camelCase.
- Commit messages: `<type>: <description>` (imperative, single line). Types: fix, feat, refactor, test, docs, perf, security, chore.
